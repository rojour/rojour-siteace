Consideration:

1. The file system is different to the one learned at the Coursera class.
    I don't like to have all templates in one page. I found difficult to
    find things. Same goes for the .js files for the events and the helpers.
    Hope you like it.
2. I found the rules of sorting a bit confusing. I posted on the forum an
    found that other people found the same issue. The moderator said that
    it was done on purpose.
    I decided to add a button to change those choices.
3. Comments added by the users are ordered by the newest ones first. To me
    that's what makes more sense. I could have added a button to me able to
    change that, but I found quite complicated to that and don't see much of
    point of doing that.
    I hope this is acceptable to you.
4. BUTTON TO DELETE THE COMMENTS - ONLY BY THE WRITER
5. Users are only allowed to vote a site up and/or down once. If the user attempts
    a second time, a banner will inform that they are not allowed to do that.
